# Network Vulnerability Scanner

This project is a network vulnerability scanner developed in Python. The script performs several tasks to identify active hosts on a network and check which ports are open on those hosts. It also conducts a more detailed scan using Nmap to identify services and their versions, and generates a report with the findings.

# Features

    - Active Host Detection: Scans a range of IPs to identify which hosts are active on the network.
    - Port Checking: Scans ports on each host to determine which ones are open.
    - Nmap Scanning: Uses Nmap to obtain detailed information about running services and their versions.
    - Report Generation: Creates a CSV file with the scan results, including IPs, open ports, services, versions, and potential vulnerabilities.

# How to Use

    - Set the Network Prefix: Adjust the network_prefix variable in the code to the network prefix you want to scan (e.g., "192.168.1").
    - Run the Script: Execute the Python script to start the scan.
    - Check the Report: The generated report will be saved as vulnerability_report.csv in the execution directory.
